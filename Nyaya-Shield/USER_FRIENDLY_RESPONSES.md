**Bot responds:**

```
I'll walk you through the process step by step! 📝

**Your question is about Family Law. You want to know the legal procedure 
or steps to follow. This relates to divorce, matrimonial matters.**

### Here's what you need to know:

The divorce procedure in India depends on the personal law applicable 
(Hindu Marriage Act, Special Marriage Act, etc.). For mutual consent 
divorce, both parties file a joint petition stating they have been living 
separately for at least one year and cannot live together.

After first motion, there is a cooling-off period of 6 months (can be waived). 
After this period, second motion is filed and if both parties maintain their 
consent, divorce is granted.

For contested divorce, one party files petition on grounds specified in the 
applicable act (cruelty, adultery, desertion, etc.). Court conducts hearings, 
examines evidence, and may order mediation. If grounds are proved, divorce 
decree is granted.

### 🔑 Key Takeaways:
✓ Mutual consent requires 1 year separation and joint petition
✓ Cooling-off period of 6 months (can be waived)
✓ Contested divorce requires valid grounds under applicable law
✓ Court may order mediation before granting divorce

### 📋 What You Should Do:
**1.** Determine applicable personal law (Hindu/Muslim/Christian/Special Marriage Act)
**2.** For mutual consent: File joint petition after 1 year separation
**3.** Attend first motion hearing
**4.** Wait for 6-month cooling-off period (or apply for waiver)
**5.** File second motion if both parties still consent
**6.** Obtain divorce decree from court

### Example 5: Property Law Query (Definition)

**User asks:** "What is mutation of property?"

**Bot responds:**

```
Let me explain that for you! 📖

**Your question is about Property Law. You want to understand the legal 
definition or meaning. This relates to mutation, property matters.**

### Here's what you need to know:

Mutation is the process of changing or transferring the title of property 
from one person to another in the revenue records of the local municipal 
corporation or gram panchayat.

When property is sold, inherited, or gifted, mutation updates the records 
to reflect the new owner's name. This is important for payment of property 
tax and establishing ownership for revenue purposes.

However, mutation does not confer ownership rights - it is merely a record 
update. Actual ownership is established through registered sale deed or 
other valid title documents. Mutation can be applied for at the local 
municipal office with necessary documents like sale deed, death certificate 
(for inheritance), or gift deed.

### 🔑 Key Takeaways:
✓ Mutation is updating revenue records with new owner's name
✓ Does not confer ownership rights - only updates tax records
✓ Required for property tax payment in new owner's name
✓ Actual ownership is through registered sale deed

### 📚 Legal References:
**Acts:** Local Municipal Acts, Revenue Records
